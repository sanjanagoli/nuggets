# Maps

This directory contains maps for the Nuggets game.
Feel free to add your own.

* `main.txt`: an interesting map for playing and testing.

* `fewspots.txt`: a map with too-few empty spots to support a game with 26 players and many gold piles.

* `small.txt`: a simple, small map; also too-few empty spots.

* `big.txt`: an augmented version of main with some cross-connections.

* `hole.txt`: a version of main with a large hole in the middle of one room

* `weirdtunnels.txt`: our new map which features winding, disorienting tunnels.
