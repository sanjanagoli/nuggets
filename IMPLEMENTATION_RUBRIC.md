# CS50 Implementation Rubric (26/30)

At the time you submit the plan, the plan should provide

* an overview of the module(s) in your implementation,
* the prototype and *brief* description of each function,
* description of the C data structure(s) you plan to use.

We're looking for a clear, modular structure with well-chosen data structures, function names, and function interfaces.

We grade this section out of 30 points.

## Teams of 3 students:

* (6/6) module structure, cohesion, coupling
* (6/8) function prototypes (server)
	* Good job on prototypes for your modules, but what about the prototypes for functions in server (i.e. handleMessage, messageParser, etc.)
* (6/8) function descriptions (server)
	* Good job on descriptions for your module functions, but what about functions in server (i.e. handleMessage, messageParser, etc.)
* (8/8) data structures (server)
	* add definition for each struct (i.e. what are it's internal variables)

## Teams of 4 students: (same as above, plus the client)

* (/6) module structure, cohesion, coupling
* (/5) function prototypes (server)
* (/5) function descriptions (server)
* (/5) data structures (server)
* (/3) function prototypes (client)
* (/3) function descriptions (client)
* (/3) data structures (client)
